# Miscellaneous *code*

Bits and pieces of code written in different languages just for kicks and giggles. None of these files are really related in any specific way, even though some might accomplish the similar things.



###Languages

Some of the languages I am planning on putting in here:

* Lua
* Javascript
* Prolog
* C++
* Lisp
